# fortnite-bot-lobby-helper
This script automatically ready ups and quits the game.
Use this on a new account to host bot lobbies without having to ready up manually.
Also read the comments in Zen.py for more info.

I will mostly update the Zen.py file and maybe make a release every once in a while.

If you are running this script on an IDE like Pycharm you might see a lot of errors but the script should work anyway. (i use VSCode)
